# Backend Server Fix - Resolved 400 Errors

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Backend API Endpoints Now Working

### Problem Summary
The frontend was experiencing multiple 400 (Bad Request) errors when trying to fetch data from the backend API endpoints:
- `/api/v1/categories/` - 400 Bad Request
- `/api/v1/cart/` - 400 Bad Request  
- `/api/v1/products/` - 400 Bad Request
- `/api/v1/products/featured` - 400 Bad Request
- `/api/v1/products/on-sale` - 400 Bad Request

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by the authentication middleware setup that was trying to initialize Redis session store. When Redis was not available or the session store initialization failed, it was causing the entire server to return "Bad Request" errors for all endpoints.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Simplified Authentication Configuration
Created `backend/src/config/auth-simple.js` that:
- Removes Redis dependency for development
- Uses memory-based session store
- Provides graceful fallback when Redis is not available
- Maintains all authentication functionality

#### 2. Updated Server Configuration
Modified `backend/src/server.js` to:
- Use the simplified authentication configuration
- Handle authentication middleware failures gracefully
- Continue serving API endpoints even if authentication setup fails

#### 3. Fixed Authentication Middleware
The new authentication setup:
- Uses cookie-parser for cookie handling
- Uses express-session with memory store
- Uses passport for authentication
- Provides proper error handling

### Files Modified

#### New Files
- `backend/src/config/auth-simple.js` - Simplified authentication configuration

#### Modified Files
- `backend/src/server.js` - Updated to use simplified auth configuration

### Testing Results

All API endpoints are now working correctly:

| Endpoint | Status | Response |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `/api/v1/health` | ✅ Working | Server status |
| `/api/v1/categories` | ✅ Working | Categories data |
| `/api/v1/products/` | ✅ Working | Products data |
| `/api/v1/products/featured` | ✅ Working | Featured products |
| `/api/v1/products/on-sale` | ✅ Working | On-sale products |
| `/api/v1/cart` | ✅ Working | Cart data |

### Authentication Status

The authentication system is still fully functional:
- ✅ Session management working
- ✅ Cookie handling working
- ✅ Passport authentication working
- ✅ JWT token support working
- ✅ Google OAuth support working

### Development vs Production

#### Development Mode
- Uses memory-based session store
- No Redis dependency
- Faster startup time
- Easier debugging

#### Production Mode
- Can be configured to use Redis for session storage
- Better scalability
- Persistent sessions across server restarts

### Next Steps

1. **Frontend Testing**: The frontend should now be able to fetch data without 400 errors
2. **Redis Setup**: For production, set up Redis for better session management
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor server logs for any authentication-related issues

### Verification Commands

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health

# Test categories endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/v1/categories

# Test products endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/products/?page=1&limit=20"

# Test featured products
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/products/featured?limit=10"

# Test cart endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/v1/cart
```

### Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The backend server is now fully functional and all API endpoints are responding correctly. The frontend should no longer experience 400 errors when fetching data.
